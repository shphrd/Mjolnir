Mjolnir v1.0
==================
Pronounced [MYOL-n(ee)r](http://youtu.be/kq2qGkfpUsY)
MOOL-NEER

In Norse mythology, Mjölnir is the hammer of Thor, the Norse god of thunder. Mjölnir is depicted in Norse mythology as one of the most fearsome weapons, capable of leveling mountains.


Static HTML Template for [Hammer for Mac](http://hammerformac.com/) using [Zurb's](http://www.zurb.com/) [Foundation 4](http://foundation.zurb.com/) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/).

Sadly Hammer doesn't use [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) so it will use the [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) mixin library that is included in [Hammer](http://hammerformac.com/) instead.

I have also added in [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) for easy custom icons.

Forked // July 30 2013:
Updated Font-Awesome v3.0.2 to v.3.2.1
Updated Zurb Foundation v4.2.0 to v4.3.1
